# Unity-LightJSON
An improved version of a project that I worked on in my second year of university. Contains a custom implementation of LightJSON library. This project is designed to interface with GCP to collect data from the Google Sheets API. 

Thanks to Luke Andrews, Senior Software Engineer @ Coinmode for academic year 2020-2021.
